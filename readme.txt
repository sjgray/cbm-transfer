============

CBMX-Transfer is a front-end to several command-line utilities for transferring files
and working with disk images. CBM-Transfer makes using those utilities easy by
providing a familiar windows interface that removes the need to learn the commandline
syntax of each program. CBM-Transfer also includes a multi-format file and picture viewer.

CBM-Transfer is written in VisualBASIC 6.
CBM-Transfer (aka "CBMXfer") Version 1.00 marks the program's 10th Anniversary.

Command-line utilities supported:

OPENCBM  - transfers files/images to/from a real CBM drive connected via an 'X-cable' on the parallel port.
C1541    - a utility from VICE that works with CBM Image Files (ie: D64,D71,D81 files).
NIBTOOLS - Utilities to transfer images via parallel port. Supports protected disks.
IMGCOPY  - Utility to image IEEE and 1581 disks.
ACME     - 6502-family Assembler
MD5      - File ID utility
