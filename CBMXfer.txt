CBM-Transfer (C)2007-2018 Steve J. Gray (sjgray@rogers.com)  www.stevegray.ca
============ V1.10a - Aug 10,2018

   CBM-Transfer (aka CBMXfer) is a freeware file transfer program for Windows which lets you
  transfer files to and from a Commodore IEC or IEEE drive attached to the PC via X-Cable
  (OpenCBM compatible cable, including Zoom Floppy USB) or CBMLink cable. It is also a
  full-featured Commodore file viewer.

  CBM-Transfer is a front-end (GUI) to several command-line utilities including:

    * OpenCBM.... Device driver and utilities to connect a Commodore IEC drive via "X-Cable"
		  or USB (Zoom Floppy adapter)
    * CBMLink.... Talks to a Commodore computer via serial cable
    * Vice....... Emulators plus C1541 utility - Works with Commodore Disk Image files (like D64)
    * NibTools... Low-level disk "nibbler" utilities using parallel port cables

   CBM-Transfer will have limited use without at least one of the above utilties. Please see
  below for installation instructions!

  CBM-Transfer is based on GUI4CBM4WIN by Leif Bloomquist, Wolfgang Moser, and Spiro Trikaliotis.
  GUI4CBM4WIN Version 0.4.1 sourcecode was used as the base. CBM-Transfer also includes portions
  of CBM2BMP v1.1 by Peter Weighill.


Introduction
============

   I purchased an XM1541 cable to backup my Commodore disk collection and preserve some of the
  old software and files from the old days. I also have some 8050 and SFD disks that I want to
  back up. Unfortunately, because these are IEEE devices they are not usable with the XM1541
  cable and GUI4CBM4WIN ("G4C" from now on). 

   I didn't want to mess around with DOS or DOS-based utilities like STAR COMMANDER and wanted
  to do everything in Windows. I found G4C 0.4.1 and started playing with it. It was okay but
  I found it lacking in some areas.

   As a VB6 programmer I wanted to fix it up. Then I found it had been converted to VB.NET.
  Unfortunately I do not have VB.NET and I also find it too different and bulky for my tastes,
  so I decided to stay with VB6.

   Having two different development forks for G4C makes no sense so I decided to rename mine
  to CBM-Transfer, a much easier name. CBM-Transfer has additional features that set it apart
  feature-wise from G4C. 

   In 2011 I purchased a Zoom Floppy adapter with IEEE connector and parallel cable for the 1541.
  The Zoom Floppy allows you to connect your drives via USB. For new computer users this might
  be your only option. The parallel cable allows you to backup copy-protected disks very quickly.

   I look forward to user feedback. Please email me your bug reports, and ideas to help me
  improve the program! Enjoy!

Installation
============

   CBM-Transfer is compatible with machines running Windows95 or later, and has been tested on
  versions upto and including Windows 10. It is a 32-bit Windows app but will also run on
  64-bit Windows.

  There are three different releases:

	(1) Complete release with setup.exe installer - for new installations.
	(2) Complete release files only - for people that have installed previous releases.
        (3) Test releases - minor updates with bug fixes or test features for people that want
		to experiment or have issues with the complete release, or have been asked by me
		to test bug fixes etc.

  CBM-Transfer is a GUI for OpenCBM, VICE, and others. You will also need to download and install
  these separately:

	OpenCBM  (For X cable or Zoom Floppy. ZF users make sure to use the correct version!
		  Now includes 'ImgCopy') SEE NOTE BELOW
		http://spiro.trikaliotis.net/opencbm-0.4.99.98/opencbm.html

		http://www.trikaliotis.net/Download/opencbm-0.4.99.98/opencbm-0.4.99.98.zip
		http://zadig.akeo.ie/         (USB Driver installer needed for Win7 or later)

	WinVice  (2.3 or higher recommended. Version 3.2 is latest at the time of this document.
                  Includes 'C1541.EXE' utility - SEE NOTES!)
		http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/

  These downloads are optional depending on your equipment:

	CBMLink  (If you want to use CBMLink Cables)
		http://zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/crossplatform/transfer/CBM-to-PC/index.html

	Nibtools (For ZF or X cable with parallel option)
		http://c64preservation.com/files/nibtools/
	

   I recommend installing OpenCBM and WinVICE first, rebooting, and making sure they work properly.
  Installation of OpenCBM may require administrative access to install correctly!

     NOTE: The OpenCBM drivers are not signed which will cause issues in 64-bit versions of
           Windows VISTA and higher. OpenCBM 4.99 now has special installation instructions.
           Please refer to the OpenCBM documentation.

   Once OpenCBM is installed you can install CBM-Transfer. Unzip the download file to a temporary location, then
  do ONE of the following depending on which you downloaded:

  For (1): Run setup.exe and change the installation to the location that OpenCBM was installed.
  For (2): Copy the files into the OpenCBM folder.
  For (3): Copy the new cbmxfer.exe to the OpenCBM folder.

  Now copy the "C1541.EXE" file from the WinVice directory to the same.

     IMPORTANT!: For WinVICE 3 you will also need to copy the "libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll" file or it will not work!

   If you want to use IEEE drives, copy the "CBMLINK.EXE" file there too. Finally, if you have a Zoom Floppy
  with parallel cable copy the NibTools EXE files (nibread, nibwrite, nibconv) and/or the ImgCopy utility as well. 

   If you installed (1) then there will be an entry in the start menu.
   If you installed (2) or (3) then you need to manually create a shortcut on your desktop.


Troubleshooting installation problems
=====================================

   CBM-Transfer is written using VisualBASIC 6. Most releases of Windows already include the VB6 runtime files, but
  some "light" versions, such as Windows tablets may not.  If you run into problems when starting CBM-Transfer,
  such as "component not registered", or not found, then you may need to install the complete release with SETUP.EXE.
  This will contain all the runtime files you need. If you still have difficulty try installing one or both of the
  following:

    https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24417
    https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7030

   OpenCBM does not work properly on later versions of window because it does not have signed drivers. It is
  recommended to use the Zadig driver installer as detailed in the OpenCBM installation guide.

   I recommend that you install VICE 2.3 or later as the version 2.2 "C1541.EXE" utility seems to
  have a bug. 

   If you are having trouble reading from X-cable or Viewing Disk Images make sure that the required files
  are in the directory, AND that they work on their own. Use the "RESULTS" button to view any error messages
  that might be generated. This could indicate an improper installation of OpenCBM or VICE files.


Program Configuration
=====================

   When you start the program for the first time you will be taken directly to the options
  window where you can set the program options. On the left are the available option
  categories. Selecting one will change which options are visible.

   Click OK when you are done. The next time the program runs you will go to the main screen and won't
  see the option screen unless you click the "Options" button.

  General:

    Default Destination Mode.. Selects which will be the default view in the right pane.
    Log all commands.......... Writes exact command to logfile. Use the "Show Log" button to view the log.  
    Check for EXE's........... Not implemented yet.  
    Preview shell commands.... Display command-line before operation.
    Write P00 files........... Determines if DOS filenames or P00 files are created when copying from
                               within Disk Images.
    Automatically refresh..... Normally checked.
    Confirm D64 creation...... Asks confirmation.
    Treat Dxx files........... Normally unchecked. Disables image writing.
    Ignore BAD disk ID's...... Lets disks with bad Disk ID's still be imaged with D64COPY rather than NIBTOOLS
    For results button also... Opens the CBMXFERERR.TXT file when the results button is pressed. 
    Start with DAD............ Opens the DAD window and minimizes the main window at startup.

  Paths:

    Remember PATHs............ Check to remember the last PATHs used, and restore then on startup.
    Source Directory.......... Default folder of your files (probably images). Click "..." to select.
    Destination Directory..... Default folder of right-side Local PC. Click "..." to select.
    Use Current Button........ Take the current path as the default.
    Clear History Button...... Clears the Path History drop-down menu.
    Auto add to History....... Automatically adds new paths to the History drop-down.


  X-Cable:

    Default Device Number..... Usually 8.
    Mode...................... The protocol used to communicate (see OpenCBM manual).
    Disable warp mode......... Check if you have trouble (see opencbm manual).
    Detect Drive Button....... Shows you the ID's of all connected drives.
    Reset Bus Button ......... Does just that.

  CBMLink:

    Default Unit.............. Normally U8,D0 (Device 8, drive 0). Many IEEE drives are dual
			       units, so you can select drive 1 if desired.
    Connection String......... Specifies the port and speed, usually "serial 19200,com1".

  VICE:

    Enable for Dxx............ Enable if you want to run Vice for commodore files.
    Path to Vice folder....... The path only, NOT to a specific emulator. Use the "..." button to select.
    For D64/D71/D80 (3 items). Specifies the emulator to run for specific image types. For example,
		       	       D64's are probably C64 disks, but D80's are probably PET disks. Use the
			       drop-down menu to select the proper emulator from the list. Select "NONE"
			       to disable, or select "ASK ME" to be prompted to select one manually.
    For PRG Files............. For PRG file they could be for any machine. Select whether to always run
			       a specific emulator (as above), or have the program read the
                               load address of the file and select the matching emulation.

  NibTools:

    Enable NibTools........... You will need a parallel cable for these options
    Create NIB / NBZ.......... These are ALWAYS created since NIBREAD does not create G64/D64 directly.
 			       If not selected the NIB/NBZ file will be deleted after conversion.
    Create G64 / D64.......... These are created by NIBCONV using the NIB file.
    Write D64................. Also uses NibWrite to write D64/D71 files.
    Start/End Track........... Optional. Overrides defaults if selected.
    Switches.................. Common NibTools option (see NibTools documentation for details).
    Additional Options........ Optional. Specify addition switches here (not checked for validity).
    Custom.................... Check to use custom option strings for NibRead, NibWrite, and NibConv. If this
			       option is NOT checked then the switches above will be used.
    NIBREAD................... Custom option string for NibRead
    NIBWRITE.................. Custom option string for NibWrite
    NIBCONV................... Custom option string for NibCon

  Filenames:

    When CBM filenames........ Commodore filenames can contain characters that are not allowed in
                               the Windows file system. These must be fixed before saving to the local PC.
	- Leave as-is......... Lets you edit the filename manually (forces Confirm/Edit filename)
	- Remove invalid...... Removes all invalid characters (caution: May remove entire filename!)
	- Replace invalid..... Replaces with specified character(s).
	- Confirm/Edit........ Enable to allow additional editing after any substitutions above

       NOTE: If the Commodore application requires specific filenames that contain invalid characters
             it is recommended that you create a Disk Image rather than copying the files to the
             local PC. Alternately you can enable the "Write P00" option to create P00 files. P00 files
             contain a header that preserves the true CBM filename in the header but uses a
	     file-system friendly filename on disk.

  Batch Imaging:

    Enable Batch Disk Imaging.. Enable Batch mode
	- Manual Filename Entry.. Asks for label for each disk
	- Use Disk Label......... Uses label from disk header...
				  Caution: Duplicate headers will overwrite previous
	- Numbered, Starting at.. Numbers the disk from starting number entered
	- Double-sided........... Adds both sides of a "flippy disk". 
	- Filename format........ The template for image names. Uses the following special characters
				  for variables:
				  #=Disk Number digit placeholder (If you want a 3-digit number use 3 #'s)
				  %=Disk Side a or b (lowercase)
				  ^=Disk Side A or B (uppercase)
				  *=Disk Side 1 or 2

    Log Disk Labels.......... Not Implemented. Looking for suggestions!
    Log Disk Contents........ Not Implemented

  Fonts:
    Use 'C64..' font......... Uses alternate font. Must be installed in your system fonts directory


PETSCII, ASCII, CBMDOS, MSDOS etc
=================================

 A few words about these different systems and how it affects what you can do. First some definitions:

   * PETSCII...... The character encoding used on Commodore systems. A pre-ASCII variant that contains many
                   unique symbols, glyphs (graphic symbols), plus re-ordered letters.
   * ASCII........ The standard encoding system. Does not contain any special graphic symbols.
   * CBMDOS....... The operating system of the Commodore disk drives.
   * MSDOS........ The operating system for command-line utilities (opencbm, c1541, nibtools)
   * FILE SYSTEM.. A system to store files, with folders (sub-directies) etc. A file system has limitations
                   on what characters can be used in filenames.

   There are fundamental differences between Commodore PETSCII vs ASCII, and CBMDOS vs MSDOS. This means you
  must be aware of how to handle these differences. Commodore disks use PETSCII and may contain files with
  names that can not be represented using ASCII. Therefore, some translation may be necessary when
  transfering files to MSDOS, which uses ASCII. The OpenCBM utilities, and C1541.EXE show these files using
  ASCII so you may not be able to see the true filename or even transfer the file.


Basic Operation
===============

  The main window is divided into three areas;

   * Left/Local/Source (PC) pane.
   * Centre area for mode and transfer operations.
   * Right/Remote/Destination (Commodore) pane.

   The LEFT side is where your "Local" PC files are, where you can work with Disk Image files,
  and also to view files. The LEFT side can be expanded to show both files and Disk Image contents.

   The RIGHT side displays the directories from remote Commodore drives that are connected via an X-Cable,
  Zoom Floppy, CBMLink cable, and additionally Disk Images. You can view the local PC as well, for copying
  files within Disk Images, or just for convenience.


Centre Section
--------------

  The centre section contains the two main transfer buttons, and a few other buttons.

    * Options button............. Brings up program options window (see above).
    * Results button............. Displays output from last CMD operation.
    * About button............... For program information etc. 
    * Help button................ Displays this Help text file.
    * DAD button................. Shows or Hides the "Drag And Drop" window.

    * Right Arrow ("->") button.. Copies from the LEFT to the RIGHT.
    * Left Arrow ("<-") button... Copies from the RIGHT to the LEFT.

   Also at the top left and bottom right are two expander buttons (">>" and "<<") that expands or hides
  elements on the left and right.


Left Pane
---------

   The LEFT pane is your "Source" pane. At the top are two coloured buttons to select which information
  is displayed:
 
    * Local PC.... Standard PC files; Floppy, Hard drive, or Mapped Network drives. 
    * Disk Image.. The contents of a Commodore Disk Image (D64, D80, NIB etc).

   The selected button will have the name in bold white text. Un-selected buttons have black text. You
  may also click the ">>" button in the top centre section to expand the left pane to dual view and show
  BOTH local PC and Disk Image. Click "<<" to return to single view. You can still use the top buttons to
  select the source when transferring to the right side pane.

  NOTE: When in dual view, clicking on a supported image file on the left side listing will automatically
        open it in the right side.

  Local PC:

   When "Local PC" is selected you will see the current directory. At the top is the directory path.
  You can type here to change directly to a specific directory, then press ENTER. You can also drag and
  drop a folder icon here. There is a drop-down list for "Favorites" or Path History (selectable in
  options menu). To the left is an UP ARROW to change to the parent directory (one level UP).
  Click the "..." button to select a new directory to view. The ">>"  control lets you toggle separate
  drive and path controls. Click "<<" to hide them again.

  The DOWN TRIANGLE button brings up a drop-down menu to work with the paths:

  * Explore LEFT Directory........ Opens the LEFT directory in an explorer Window
  * Explore RIGHT Directory....... Opens the RIGHT directory in an explorer Window
  * Swap LEFT and RIGHT........... Swaps LEFT and RIGHT paths.
  * Set LEFT...................... Makes LEFT path same as the RIGHT.
  * Set RIGHT..................... Makes RIGHT path the same as the LEFT.
  * Add Current Path to History... Adds the path
  * Remove Current Path........... Removes the path
  * Clear History................. Clears the Source Path history list.
  * Create New Folder............. Prompts for new folder name and creates it in the current folder

  NOTE: You can enable "Auto add Path" in the Options/path tab to automatically add new paths to the
        drop-down menu. Paths will be saved on exit.

  Below those buttons are the files from the selected directory. At the bottom are the file-related
  buttons and totals KB and Blocks for any selected file(s).

  * Refresh...... Refreshes the file list

  * Rename....... Rename selected file(s). If multiple files are selected it will prompt for each file.
                  To abort click the "Cancel All" button.

  * Delete....... Delete selected file(s)
  * New Dnn...... Creates a new, blank Disk Image. The extension determines the type.

  * Run.......... Smart button. Runs EXE files, edits TXT files, or runs VICE
  * View......... Smart button. View Commodore files.
  * 2............ Smart button. Select Disk Image to be viewed in Destination (right pane).
                  The Disk Image tab must be selected for this to work, otherwise it operates
                  just like the "View" Button.

   The "File Filter" lets you pick which types of files to view. So, for example, if you set it to
  "D64" then you will only see files with an extension of "D64". Some options show files of a single
  file type and others show groups of related files. For example, "Disk Images" shows you all image
  types such as D64,G64,D71,D80,NIB etc. Picking "CUSTOM..." prompts for your own filter string.
  For example "*.PNG;*.PDF" will display only PNG or PDF files.

   You can select one or more files in the usual Windows method (SHIFT/CTRL). The size and "blocks"
  (Commodore drive blocks) will be shown for all selected to help you figure out how much will fit on
  a disk when copied.

  If you click on a file with the extension "PRG","SEQ" or NO EXTENSION you can view the file on the
  built-in CBM Viewer. See "File Viewer" below.

  If you click on a "Dxx" or "G64" image file then click "Run", you can load the image into a specific
  VICE emulation chosen for that image type. The emulator will load and attach the image and autorun
  the first file inside the image.

  Disk Image:

  This tab lets you view the contents of any supported Disk Image file.

  If you click on a "Dxx" image file then click "View" the Dxx file will be opened and you can view
  the contents of the disk on the LEFT side. When you are viewing an image file you can copy files
  from inside the image to the RIGHT pane or view files in the file viewer! Clicking "Run", loads
  VICE, attaches the image, and runs the selected file.

  If you click on a "NIB" or "NBZ" image file then "View" you will be prompted to convert the file
  to D64 first before viewing.

  You may also view an Image File by first clicking on the Disk Image button at the top, then dragging
  and dropping the file to the file list area. Only one file may be dropped at a time.

  The following buttons are available:

  * Refresh........ Re-read the image file.
  * ++/-- ......... Selects ALL files in the list, or deselect ALL files.
  * Del............ Deletes selected file(s) file from the image.
  * Ren............ Renames selected file(s) in the image.
  * View........... Displays the file in the File Viewer. Files are extracted to a temporary file
                    in order to be viewed.
  * Run............ Starts the appropriate Vice emulator, attaches the current image and autoruns
		    the selected PRG file. 
  * DOWN TRIANGLE.. Drop-down menu with options to save the disk directory as a text file, add it to the
                    Catalog, and to view the Catalog.

   To return to the normal PC directory click on the "Local PC" button at the top. You can freely
  swap between the Local PC directory and the Disk Image.

  NOTE: PETSII as used by Commodore contains many special symbols and graphics characters that have no
        equivilent in ASCII and therefor are "non-printable". The "C1541.EXE" program that allows
        CBMXfer to view disk images, will display any non-printable characters as PERIODS. Most likely
        you will not be able to copy these files to the LocalPC directory, however when disk images are
        written to real CBM disk drives these files will appear as normal.


Right Pane
----------

   This lets you view directories on Commodore drives connected via OpenCBM or CBMLink. Click on the
  coloured button at the top to select which to view.


  CBM Drive on X-Cable / Zoom Floppy (USB):

  There are two different interfaces you can use to connect drives to your computer:

    * Zoom Floppy
    * X-Cable

   For most computers a Zoom Floppy adapter is recommended. It is a modern USB interface to both IEC and
  IEEE devices. The ZF adapter might be your only option if you have a newer computer with no
  printer/parallel port. The ZF adapter also supports  "parallel cable", which is a modification to the
  Commodore drive to add a fast parallel data connection. With the parallel cable you can backup many
  protected or non-standard disks using the NibTools utilities.

	Note: Make sure you are using the latest release of OpenCBM that includes
	      Zoom Floppy support! Version 4.99 is current as of this writing.


   For older computer without USB your computer will need a printer/parallel port in order to use an
  "X-cable". The X-cable connects a Commodore IEC drive (1541, 1571, 1581 etc) or other drive (1541-III,
  uIEC) to the PC via the printer port and uses OpenCBM for communication.

	IMPORTANT!: There are several different types of X-Cables. I recommend you use an "XM"
		    or "XA" type for use with windows. Other types may not work.

   At the top is the device# drop-down menu, and to its right is the disk drive model name or names.
  Below in blue, are the Disk Title and ID, the Files, Blocks free, and drive status. On the right edge are 
  action buttons.

  Generally you will first select the device to use from the device# menu, then press the DIRECTORY button
  to read the directory from the disk. If you have multiple drives attached you can click on the model# box
  to scan the devices on the bus.  If a 1571 drive is detected as the current device it will ask
  you if you want to use double-sided mode.

  * Directory......... reads the disk from on the currently selected drive unit
  * Format............ Formats the disk
  * Init.............. Initializes the disk (like re-reading)
  * Val............... Validate the disk (re-calculate BAM)
  * Rename............ Rename files
  * Scratch........... Delete files
  * View.............. Display the File Viewer window.
	         	Supports BASIC, SEQ, BINARY, CHRSET and ML files.
  * Root.............. Return to Root partition of 1581 disk (*)
  * Sel............... Enter/Select highlighted 1581 disk partition (*)
  * All............... Select ALL files
  * None.............. De-select ALL files.

  Note: (*) these buttons are only visible when a 1581 drive is selected.


  CBM Drive via CBMLink:
  
   The CBMLink (or PRLink) cable connects a PC to a Commodore computer via the PC's serial port.
  This cable usually attaches to the Commodore machine's cassete port, but may also be connected to
  a serial port if available. The Commodore drives are connected to the Commodore computer as usual.
  The CBMLink program must be loaded on the Commodore computer. There is a version specific to each
  Commodore machine.

  Once CBMLink is running, any drive that is attached can be accessed. CBMLink is commonly used on
  the older PET machines to access IEEE drives (4040, 8050 etc).

  At the top is a drop-down menu to select the device number and drive number (to accomodate dual
  drive units).

  Make sure that the correct speed and COM port are set in the CBM-Transfer options!

  The layout is very similar to the X-Cable, minus the 1581 buttons. The drive selector
  drop-down menu has additional options for dual drive units.


  Local PC:

  Same as the LocalPC tab on the LEFT.

  Disk Image:

  Same as the Disk Image tab on the LEFT.


DAD Window
==========

   The DAD (Drag And Drop) window can be opened and closed by clicking the "DAD" button on the main screen.
  It can be opened automatically when the program starts by setting the "Show DAD.." option. The DAD window
  allows you to use Windows Explorer as your interface for Image file creation, disk imaging, and file
  viewing. You can Drop any supported image file or files to this window and the image will be written to
  the currently selected drive on the X-cable interface. If you drop a supported PRG, SEQ, or picture file
  then it will be viewed (if multiple files are dropped only the first will be viewed).

   By clicking in this window you are prompted to Create an Image File from the current disk in the
  selected drive. Images are saved to the currently selected path on the left side (source).


File Transfer
=============

   Basically, you select the file or files you want to copy and click the "->" or "<-" button in the
  centre section that points in the direction you want to copy. To select multiple files use the standard
  windows convention of SHIFT to select a range, or CTRL to select individual files.

   To write D64 images (and others) to disk, select the image file in the LEFT pane and Commodore drive
  in the RIGHT (ie: X-Cable or CBMLink cable) then click the "->" button. If you select multiple images
  on the left then you will enable BATCH mode. You will be prompted to insert a new disk for each image.

	IMPORTANT: Writing images will ERASE any data you have on the disk!!!

   To make a D64 image from a disk, make sure NO files are selected in the RIGHT pane then click the
  "<-" button. You will be asked for a name to save the image (the Disk Title will be the default).
  If you have a 1571 dual-sided floppy, simply change the extension to D71.

   If you have a parallel connection in your Commodore drive you can enable the "Use NibTools"
  option and create additional image types NIB, NBZ or G64 in a similar fashion. NibTools has many options,
  so please refer to the Nibtools documentation for correct usage of the various switches.

   When transfering files from Commodore disk, PRG and SEQ extensions will added automatically to the
  filename on the PC. When PRG and SEQ files are written to Commodore disk the PRG and SEQ will be
  removed but will appear properly as PRG or SEQ in the directory listing.

  NOTE:	Commodore uses PETSCII characters. This is a different standard than ASCII on the PC!
	Some Commodore characters or symbols do not have a matching ASCII equivilent and you may
	be asked to enter a new filename when transferring files to the PC. If you wish to preserve the
	Commodore filename then you can enable the "Write P00" option.


File Viewer
===========

   The file viewer is designed to view various Commodore files. Since Commodore DOS doesn't use EXTENSIONS
  like the PC, there are only two Commodore file types you can view... PRG and SEQ (USR and REL are not
  supported at this time). You can also view ROM/BIN files, which are commonly used for ROM contents. We can
  assume SEQ files are plain data, probably text. However, without an extension we don't know what
  type of file a PRG might be. There must be a way for the user to change how the file is viewed. At the
  top of the viewer window are coloured buttons to select the VIEW MODE. You can select:

    * BASIC... Displays tokenized Commodore BASIC files.  Most dialects and versions are supported.
    * SEQ..... Displays as text.
    * HEX..... Displays Binary file as HEX values plus Text (non-printing characters are shown as ".")
    * FONT.... Displays as 8x8 (normal) or 8x16 (CBM-II) format FONT file. Is also a font editor!
    * ASM..... Displays 6502 Assembly code with various formatting options.
    * BITMAP.. Displays supported CBM format picture formats such as KoalaPainter and GeoPaint files.

   Also on the top are the "LA" checkbox. This tells the various viewers that the first two bytes of the
  file contains the Load Address. When checked these bytes will be skipped over, and any viewer that
  needs a Load Address will use this. If the box is NOT checked then the bytes are not skipped, and you
  must then supply an address for any Viewer that needs one. Moving right is the Load Address Entry box
  followed by the file size. NOTE: The maximum viewable size is 32K. If a file is bigger than the max
  it will be truncated and a red indicator will be displayed beside the size.

   When a file is viewed it is loaded into memory, and changing the views will not require the file to
  be reloaded. The exception to this is the BITMAP viewer, which always re-reads the file as needed.

   The file viewer window is scalable. It can also be left open while you work on the main window. Clicking
  the "VIEW" button in the main window will update the view in the Viewer window.

   You can enable DUAL VIEW by clicking on the "+" button to the right of the VIEW MODE buttons. The button
  will change to "-". Press the "-" button to return to SINGLE VIEW.

   When DUAL VIEW is enable you can view the same file two different ways at the same time. Several new
  buttons will appear. The ">" button shows which side (left or right) will be changed when a VIEW MODE
  button is clicked. Clicking this button toggles it between "<" and ">".  To swap left and right views,
  look at this button then click on the tab for the opposite view.

   There will also be a set of three buttons ( "<<" "|" and ">>" ) that change the sizing of the left and
  right frames from 20% to 80%. The "|" button returns it to 50%.

   Normally when viewing PRG, SEQ or BIN fles the view will change to BASIC, SEQ or BIN automatically. The
  "Lock View" option overrides this behaviour. You can also view "P00" files. The header will be skipped
  automatically. If you select a file that is not recognized you will be prompted to choose either the
  CBM-Transfer built-in viewer, or the application associated with the file extension.

   You may also drag and drop a file into the viewer window. Drag to an empty area of the viewer window
  until the pointer shows the drop symbol.

   Several TABs have Colour boxes to let you change the colour of the output list window. Clicking on the
  box opens the Colour Picker window where you will have 16 predefined colour on the left. These match the
  Commodore C64's colour palette. Click on one of those boxes selects the colour and it will be displayed
  in the box above the OK button. If you wish to select a colour that's not in the C64 palette then click
  this box and the standard colour picker window will appear. Click the OK button to select the colour, or
  cancel to abort.

  The different view TABs are:

BASIC:
------

   Takes a tokenized Commodore BASIC file in any CBM dialect. The default mode is "Auto", which
  reads the load address from the file to determine which dialect to use. Most common load addresses
  are supported, but if the basic file has been relocated you may need to select the dialect manually
  from the drop-down menu. The load address is displayed along with the target machine name. There
  are several formatting options:

    * Reverse Text.......... Switches upper and lower case (needed for some early PET files)
    * Use CBM Font.......... Switches to either "CBM 64" font or "CBM FONTS" Windows font. These
				must be installed in the system fonts folder.
    * Expand Special........ Converts 'special' formatting characters to readable descriptions.
				IE: Reverse R =  {rvs}, Reverse Heart = {cls}
		             	Use the UCase option to make them Uppercase, ie: {RVS} {CLS}		
    * Break Multi........... Breaks multiple statements to separate lines
    * Pad Tokens............ Adds additional spaces between tokens to improve readability
  
    * To Clipboard Button... pastes the listing to the clipboard.
    * Export................ saves the listing to a text file.

   The "<<" Button hides the options. Click ">>" to re-show them. There are also two colour boxes to
  manually set the listing colours.


SEQ:
----

   Displays the file as a data file, and assumes it is readable text. Non-printable text is not
  displayed. If the file contains non-printable text you might consider changing to the "BIN"
  view below.

    * Use 'SEQ Viewer' C64 Font... Uses a font called "SEQ Viewer".
    * Ignore LF................... Ignores LineFeed characters

  There are also two colour boxes to manually set the listing colours.


HEX:
----

   Displays the file as binary, using four-digit hex offset and two-digit hex values (with 16 bytes
  per line). Options are:

    * Load Address..... Uses Load Address from file.
    * Wide............. Displays 16 bytes per line
    * Show Printable... Display the ASCII/CBM equivilent characters. Unprintable characters are
                        represented with a "." character. If you de-select "Show Printable" then
                        only the hex values will be shown (with 32 bytes per line).
    * 7-bit View....... Masks off the upper bit which will allow "RVS" CBM text to be seen.
    * Show CBM......... Translates 0-31 (ASCII control codes) to Letters (CBM Screen Codes).
    * Sync with ASM.... Uses the Load Address from the ASM project setting for files with no load
                        address. Allows the Hex view to sync with selected line in the ASM listing.

  At the very top left is the Black/White toggle button to change the listing colours.


FONT:
-----

   For viewing/editing Character Set FONT files or ROMs (no checking is done to verify the file contents). The
  file may contain multiple fonts. For CBM machines one set could contain either 128 or 256 characters depending on
  if the "reverse" characters are included. PET/CBM machines generate the "reverse" characters with hardware, so
  they are not included. Commodore C64/VIC have all 256.

   At the top left is the Drop-Down menu followed by a line of control boxes:

	* Font Size.. 8x8 or 8x16 (most use 8x8, but CBM-II uses 8x16)
	* Colours.... foreground, background, border, and if enabled two Multi-colours. Click to change!
	* Theme...... Colour themes to match different computers (VIC,64,TED,PET etc)
	* Zoom Factor 1x to 6x magnification
	* Width...... Number of characters per line (8,16,32,64,128)
	* Border..... Toggles border on or off.

   The Skip Bytes field lets you start from an offset which may help when trying to view character sets
  embedded in programs or other binary files. To the right of the offset are six buttons that adjust the offset
  by -256,-8,-1,+1,+8, or +256. When Dual-View is enabled and the HEX tab is selected as the other view, clicking
  on a HEX line will set the offset value in the FONT tab. This lets you scroll through the file searching for
  embedded fonts.

   Below the top line and on the left we have the selected character controls. At the top is the currently
  selected character. You can click on a character in the set to select it, or use the "<" and ">" buttons. The
  set# and character# plus hex value are shown. Below that is the selected character with 16x zoom. This area
  will change size to show either an 8x8 or 8x16 pixel character depending on the font size setting above.

   The drop-down menu has the following options:

	* Toggle Multi-colour.. Turns Multi-color mode on or off.
	* Toggle Boder......... Turns Border lines between characters/pixels on or off.
	* Save as BMP.......... Saves the current view, including theme and zoom to a BMP file (see tip).
	* Edit Mode............ Toggle Edit Mode
	* Save Font As......... Save the curent font to a file.
	* Save Range As........ Save selected range to a file.
	* Convert.............. Submenu to convert various font formats (see below)

    	TIP: BMP files are quite big. You might like to load the BMP file into a paint program and re-save it
             as PNG or JPG to reduce the size.

  Edit Mode:
  
   Turn on Edit Mode from the drop-down menu. A Toolbar will appear on the left-hand side and the character box
  and character set will shift to the right. You can now edit the individual pixels of each character, or perform
  different operations on the selected character or a range of characters. Below the selected character is an area
  that displays crosshair info and has help info.

  The crosshairs mark the row and column where inserts and deletes are performed. Actions affect the rows BELOW
 the line, and columns to the RIGHT of the line. To set the crosshair position SHIFT-CLICK or RIGHT-CLICK in the
 character window.

  Edit tools can work on a range of characters. To set a range, CLICK on the first character you want, then
 SHIFT-CLICK or RIGHT-CLICK on the last character in the range. The characters in the range will be highlighted.
 Also, the character edit area will be hidden and an orange info area will appear that will display the characters
 in the range and the total number of characters selected.

  With either a single character or a range you can now click on a tool in the toolbar and it will operate on that
 one character or on the whole range of characters. The toolbar contains the following tools:

  Arrows........... Up/Down/Left/Right arrows. This will shift the pixels in the direction chosen. See below.
  Checkbox......... Determines if pixels shifted off the character area disappear (unchecked), or wrap to the other
                    side (checked).
  BG / FG / Xor.... Sets the draw mode:
			BG: Draws in the Background colour (Bit=0)
			FG: Draws in the Foreground colour (Bit=1)
			Xor: Inverts the pixel. 0 Bits become 1, 1 bits become 0. (default mode)

		    In multi-colour (MC) mode 2 bit pairs determine the colour:
			00: Background Colour  |
			01: Multi-colour#1     |  In MC mode only the colour is shown, not the pixels, so
			10: Multi-colour#2     |  you must imagine the pixels that produce the colour seen.
			11: Foreground Colour  |

  Clear............ Erases the character/range.
  RVS.............. Inverts the character/range - AKA Reverse.
  Bold............. Bolds the character to the right.
  Und.............. Underline (or strikethru). The line is drawn below the crosshair.
  Rot L / Rot R.... Rotate the character [L]eft or [R]ight. (8x8 characters only)
  Flip H / Flip V.. Flip the character on the [H]orizontal or [V]ertical plane.
  Ins R / Del R.... Insert or Delete ROWs below the crosshair.
  Ins C / Del C.... Insert or Delete COLUMNs to the right of the crosshair.
  Tall T / Tall B.. Creates a double-tall character [T]op or [B]ottom half.
  Wide L / Wide R.. Creates a double-wide character [L]eft or [R]ight
  2x TL/TR/BL/BR... Creates a double-size character [TL]top-left,[TR]top-right,[BL]bottom-left, or [BR]bottom-right.

  SWAP............. Swaps Main and Alternate sets. If no alternate set is loaded the main set is copied.
                    You can use the alternate set as a way to copy characters between sets. First load the
		    "alternate" font file, press the SWAP button, then load the main file you want to edit.
                    SWAP to the alternate and use the copy button, SWAP again and PASTE. 
                    NOTE: both sets must be the same pixel height.
  Sel ALL.......... Set Range to ALL characters in file.

  COPY............. Copies the current character/range to the clipboard
  PASTE............ Pastes the clipboard to the current character/range. If you select a character it becomes the
                    start character where the clipboard is pasted. If you copied more than one character they ALL
                    will be pasted. If you select a RANGE then the clipboard is pasted into that range. If the range
                    is bigger than the clipboard, the clipboard will be repeated (cloned) into that range.

  Set R Point...... Create a RESTORE POINT of the entire set.  
  Restore.......... Restores the character/range from the RESTORE POINT.
  Restore Original. Restores the character/range from the original loaded file.

  Font Conversion:

   When you load a font file, the program doesn't know what format it is: 8x8 or 8x16 pixels. To change the format
  click on the "8x8" or "8x16" buttons. If Edit Mode is OFF it will just change. If Edit Mode is ON it will prompt
  you if you'd like to convert the font to the chosen format. If you say NO, no conversion will be performed. If
  you say YES then 8-pixel tall fonts will be converted to 16-pixel tall fonts by copying the character and adding
  8 blank rows at the bottom of each. If converting 16-pixel tall fonts to 8-pixel the bottom 8 rows will be discarded.

  You can also manually convert fonts using the "Convert" submenu. The following are available:

	* Convert 8x16 to 8x8... Same as above.
	* Convert 8x8 to 8x16... Same as above.
	* Convert 5x7 sideways.. Convert 5x7 sideways font to 8x8. You will still need to rotate characters.
	* Convert 5x7 upright... Convert 5x7 upright font to 8x8.
	* Convert 8x14.......... Convert 8x14 EGA font to 8x16.

ASM:
----

   This is an interactive symbolic 6502 machine code symbolic disassembler with flow tracing. It has grown
 to a full-featured disassembler with many features. There is now a separate help file for it. Open the
 side panel with the ">>" button then click on the "Project" tab button, then click on HELP for more info.


BITMAP:
-------

   Displays supported CBM picture files. Pictures are automatically identified and displayed. If the
  file is not known, a generic B/W 320x200 pixel image will be shown. Currently supported formats are:

	* Art Studio (ART)
	* Doodle
	* Image System
	* Advanced Art Studio
	* Artist 64
	* Blazing Paddles
	* Koala Painter (KOA)
	* Vidcom 64
	* CDU Paint (CDU)
	* GeoPaint (GEO)

   CBM-Transfer recognizes files with an ART, KOA, CDU or GEO extension in the LocalPC directory. If
  a format is recognized the name will be displayed, as well as any internal comments. To save the
  currently displayed image to a Windows BMP file, click the "SAVE..." button.
 
	NOTE: The bitmap viewer contains portions of code from CBM2BMP by Peter Weighill.
 

VICE Support
============

   CBM-Transfer supports the VICE emulator (as of VICE 2.4 - available at VICETEAM.ORG). CBM-Transfer can
  be a convenient front-end for running the various machine emulators.

  There are three ways this can work:

    * Disk Images:
	Any D64, G64, D71, D80, D81 (and others) contain the data for a complete Commodore floppy
	disk in various formats for various disk drives. Inside the Disk Images can be one or more
	files in Commodore format. Clicking a Disk Image from the Local PC list and then clicking
	"Run" will run the emulator specified (you may be prompted), attach the Disk Image then run
	the first file in the directory (as if you typed LOAD "*",8,1:RUN).

	You can select which emulation is run for various Disk Images by clicking "Options", then
	"Vice" and picking the one you want from the drop-down menu. If you prefer to select the
	emulator manually then choose the "ASK ME" option.

    * Selected File in Disk Image:
	As above, but instead of clicking "Run" you click "View". The Disk Image will be loaded and
	displayed. You can then select the file you want to run then click the "Run" button.

    * PRG File:
	In the Local PC view, if you have Commodore files with a PRG extension (ie: NOT inside a disk
	image) you can click on it and select "Run". Since the PRG file is not inside a Disk Image
	it could be for ANY system. So there are two choices:
	
		* Run specified emulator..... Selected from drop-down list. The "ASK ME" option
						probably makes the most sense.
		* Use Load Address........... Probably an even better option. Reads the file and
						calculates the Load Address from the first two
						bytes. This will determine which machine it is for.

   If you select "ASK ME" then a window will be displayed with the various emulators listed. Click the
  one you wish to use. Note: You will need Vice 2.3 or higher to select the "C64 sc" emulation, and
  Vice 2.4 or higher to select the "P500" emulation.


Tips and Tricks
===============

  * For parallel port use an XM or XA cable, as these are the only cables supported by OpenCBM.
  * For USB use the Zoom Floppy adapter (recommended)
  * Make sure the X-Cable is plugged in and the drive ON before turning on your PC!
  * Check for the latest releases of Vice, OpenCBM and CBMLink
  * Set your paths to your Commodore files in the options


Drive Compatibility Notes
=========================

   These are some notes about compatibility with specific drives. Please contact me if you have any
 additional info that can be added here.
